1,Effect of interface diffusion on low-cycle fatigue behaviors of MCrAlY coated single crystal superalloys,137,,,"Shi Duoqi,Song Jianan,Qi Hongyu,Li Shaolin,Yang Xiaoguang","Shi DQ,Song JN,Qi HY,Li SL,Yang XG",Li SL (corr,10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2020.105660,"Beihang Univ, Dept Energy & Power Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.","To protect gas turbine blades from oxidation and erosion, they are commonly treated with MCrAlY coatings. However, the mechanical properties of the blades can be negatively affected by inter-diffusion with the coating. Therefore, in this study, the effect of inter-diffusion on the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of MCrAlY coated single-crystal superalloys pre-exposed to high temperatures for different durations was studied by conducting tests and observing them by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The inter-diffusion of the coating and substrate-induced by pre-exposure caused the generation of topologically-close packed (TCP) phases. Furthermore, increasing the number of TCP phases reduced the LCF life of single-crystal superalloys. To evaluate the degradation of the LCF life, an empirical life prediction model was proposed, and the calculation results fitted well with test results.","Coating,Low-cycle fatigue,Inter-diffusion,Life prediction",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,4.03,"NICKEL-BASED,SUPERALLOY,TEMPERATURE,PROTECTIVE-COATINGS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,DZ,125,EVOLUTION,PHASES",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE,,

The creep properties of the specimen subjected to two-step aging without solution heat treatment under low temperature and high stress was the best, owing to the uniform deformation and damage-relieving effect of the fine secondary gamma' particles in the. channel and the eutectic gamma/gamma' phase.

Solution heat treatment and isothermal aging treatment are applied to undeformed single crystalline samples.
We focus on the investigation of heterogeneous gamma'' precipitation on dislocation sites, without the interference of grain boundaries or co-precipitation with other phases. The gamma'' precipitation microstructure after aging is found to be strongly related to the dislocation microstructure before aging. The dislocations found in the undeformed specimens have been generated during the dendritic solidification or the water quenching after solution heat treatment.
Two specific patterns dominate the precipitation microstructure after aging. First, some gamma'' particles precipitate along curved lines formed initially by the dislocations during solution heat treatment along the dendritic boundary. Second, gamma'' particles are found to be arranged along the dislocation in slip planes, which can be seen as largely extended straight lines parallel to the <011> directions within the (001) plane, similar to a basket weave structure. Such an aligned arrangement of gamma'' particles has been previously observed in polycrystalline IN718 within individual grains (Choi and Choi, 1972). In contrast, the bands of numerous gamma'' particles can span the whole sample of millimeter size in single crystals, cutting several hundred dendrite cores. All gamma'' particles are in the shape of an oblate spheroid, where the normals of the plates are pointing in <001> directions.","INCONEL 718,DEFORMATION MECHANISMS,PHASE,MORPHOLOGY,SIMULATION,BEHAVIOR",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,3.674,"INCONEL,718,DEFORMATION,MECHANISMS,PHASE,MORPHOLOGY,SIMULATION,BEHAVIOR",MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION,,

Furthermore, the surface roughness of machined surface can be reduced to 183 nm, which indicates that the ball micro end mills with spiral blades fabricated by LS-WEDM are significantly potential to achieve high-quality machining for complex micro structures on hard material.","LS-WEDM,Ball micro end mills with spiral blades,Micro machining performance,DD5 material",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,2.925,"SURFACE-ROUGHNESS,OPTIMIZATION,DESIGN,EDGE,HARD",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,
7,Cold Spray MCrAlY Coatings on Single-Crystal Superalloy Using Nitrogen: Properties and Economics,,,,"Guo Deliang Leon,MacDonald Daniel,Zhao Linruo,Jodoin Bertrand","Guo DL,MacDonald D,Zhao LR,Jodoin B",Guo DL (corr,10.1007/s11666-020-01058-x,"Univ Ottawa, Cold Spray Res Lab, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","Cold spray (CS) has been proven a promising manufacturing process for the MCrAlY coatings deposition. In this study, NiCoCrAlTaY coatings were deposited on single-crystal nickel-based superalloy (CMSX-4) substrates using the CS technique. Nitrogen and moderate spray parameters were used, and the resulting MCrAlY coatings were compared to coatings sprayed using helium under similar spray conditions. It was found that, contrary to general expectation, favorable coating characteristics were achieved when nitrogen was used. This is attributed to low deposition efficiency under the studied spray conditions, resulting in significant particle impingement that promotes overall particle deformation in the coatings sprayed using nitrogen. However, low deposition efficiency may lead to elevated process cost, despite great gas cost savings by using nitrogen, due to significant increases in powder waste and cost. As such, recycling of the non-deposited powder was explored in an aim to reduce powder cost when using nitrogen. A general cost model that considers the benefits of powder recycling was proposed for the CS process. It was demonstrated that the use of nitrogen and powder recycling can be economical over CS using helium, while producing MCrAlY coatings with desirable properties that are potentially beneficial to the oxidation performance of the coatings.","cold spray,MCrAlY,superalloy,process economics",Article; Early Access,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Materials Science,,2.587,"GAS-DYNAMIC-SPRAY,THERMAL,BARRIER,COATINGS,ISOTHERMAL,OXIDATION,BEHAVIOR,BOND,COATS,DEPOSITION,EFFICIENCY,SURFACE,MODIFICATION,TURBINE,BLADES,VELOCITY,HVOF,EVOLUTION",JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY,,

To improve the thermodynamic stability and fracture strength of the gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni3Al interface and gain insight into the underlying micro-mechanisms, the segregation tendency of 12 alloying elements X at the gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni3Al interface and their effects on the interfacial formation and Griffith fracture works were investigated by using first-principles calculations. It is found that all alloying elements X can segregate to the corner-point site of the gamma-Ni (001) layer except the element Y. The Re-, Ti-, Mo-, W-, Cr-, Nb-, Ta-, Hf- and Zr-segregated interfaces are more stable than the unalloyed interface due to the presence of pseudogap and lower values of densities of states at the Fermi level. The segregation of Ru, Co, Re, Mo, W, Cr, Nb and Ta strengthens the interfacial fracture strength, which can be mainly attributed to the enhanced bonding strengths of X-Ni bonds formed in these segregated interfaces. The interfacial segregation of Cr, Re, Mo, W, Nb and Ta can not only improve the thermodynamic stability but also enhance the fracture strength of the phase interface. The segregation of Ta and Re is able to improve the thermodynamic stability and fracture strength of the gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni3Al interface to the maximum extent, respectively.","ZINC-INDUCED EMBRITTLEMENT,TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,GRAIN-BOUNDARY,HIGH-TEMPERATURE,GAMMA/GAMMA' INTERFACE,RE SEGREGATION,1ST-PRINCIPLES,PHASE,ALUMINUM",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Materials Science,,3.282,"ZINC-INDUCED,EMBRITTLEMENT,TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,GRAIN-BOUNDARY,HIGH-TEMPERATURE,GAMMA%2FGAMMA%27,INTERFACE,BASE,SUPERALLOY,RE,SEGREGATION,1ST-PRINCIPLES,PHASE,ALUMINUM",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE,,

Then, strain-controlled low cycle fatigue experiments were carried out under 850 degrees C with a 0 strain ratio to measure the reduction in the fatigue resistance. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the microstructures of the alloy with different treatments. The micro-deformation and dislocation movement were investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that both coarsening and rafting morphology have negative effects on the fatigue properties, which is closely related to the deformation mechanism of the alloys with different gamma morphology. The coarsening morphology decreases the shear resistance of the gamma precipitates, resulting in shearing of gamma particles. More plastic deformation introduces during the cyclic process, leading in the reduction of fatigue life. On the other hand, the wide. channel promoted the piling up and movement of dislocations in the matrix, also resulting in reduction of plastic deformation resistance and lifespan. Finally, a fatigue life prediction model was proposed based on the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) by introducing the variation of matrix channels' width, showing a good competency compared with the experimental results.","Low cycle fatigue,Microstructural morphology,Dislocation movements,Life prediction",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,4.58,"LOW-CYCLE,FATIGUE,SINGLE-CRYSTAL,SUPERALLOY,TURBINE,BLADE,NICKEL,DAMAGE,TEMPERATURE,BEHAVIOR,EVOLUTION,GROWTH",MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING,,
10,Creep behavior and a deformation mechanism based creep rate model under high temperature and low stress condition for single crystal superalloy DD5,786,,,"Xu Ke,Wang Guanglei,Liu Jide,Li Jinguo,Liu Jinlai,Wang Xinguang,Yang Yanhong,Ye Lihua,Zhou Yizhou,Sun Xiaofeng","Xu K,Wang GL,Liu JD,Li JG,Liu JL,Wang XG,Yang YH,Ye LH,Zhou YZ,Sun XF",Liu JD (corr,10.1016/j.msea.2020.139414,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.","This work reports the investigation on creep behavior under high temperature and low stress condition for single crystal superalloy DD5 and the subsequent establishment of a deformation mechanism based creep rate model. The gamma/gamma' microstructure evolution and the precipitate-dislocation interaction mode were investigated systematically during creep test at 1100 degrees C and 120 MPa, for a better understanding of underlying creep deformation characteristics. The gamma/gamma' microstructure becomes rafted and topological inverted eventually as creep deformation continues. The formation of dense interfacial dislocation network that impedes dislocations from cutting into gamma' precipitates is assumed to be one of the main strengthening mechanisms during creep. The climbing over rafted gamma' precipitates is seen as a recovery/softening process which annihilates dislocations, receding the strengthening effect of interfacial dislocation network. The cutting through rafted gamma' precipitates is proposed to account for the acceleration of creep, a strong dependence of creep properties on rafting (the effect of widening horizontal. channel on the degraded back stress of cutting through rafted gamma' precipitates) then arises. The established model involving these characteristics was found to predict the creep behavior (below 1% creep strain) under different temperatures and stresses for single crystal superalloy DD5 accurately. Several microstructure characteristics and physical properties emerge from the model, which is promising for alloy design and compositional optimization.","Creep behavior,Microstructure,Creep model",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,4.58,"NICKEL-BASED,SUPERALLOY,GAMMA%2FGAMMA%27-MICROSTRUCTURE,VOLUME,FRACTIONS,PRECIPITATION,EVOLUTION,PHASE,DISLOCATIONS,INVERSION,COHERENT,ALLOY",MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING,,
